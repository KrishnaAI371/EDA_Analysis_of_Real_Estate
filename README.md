# EDA Analysis of Real estate in Taiwan
This Project explains real estate dataset from Taiwan. It explores various aspects such as house prices,age of the houses,distace from MRT stations by using python librares
like Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn,Matplotlib.
## Objective
To derive insights from Taiwan's real estate dataset by visualizing relationships between features like house age, location, and price per unit area.
 Description: The dataset contains 414 rows and 7 features, including:
  - House age
  - Distance to the nearest MRT station
  - Number of convenience stores
  - Latitude & Longitude
  - Price per unit area
## Tools and Libraries used : 
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - VSCode
## Key Analysis Performed:
  - Distribution plots of house age and price
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Scatter plots between distance to MRT and price
  - Boxplots for identifying outliers
  - Feature relationships with price
 # Conclusion:
 - Houses closer to MRT stations tend to have higher price per unit area.
 - Age of the house has an inverse relationship with price.
 - Convenience stores and location coordinates also influence house value
